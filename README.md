# Compose News
Modular Android architecture which showcase Kotlin, MVVM, Navigation, Hilt, Coroutines, Jetpack Compose, Retrofit and Kotlin Gradle DSL.

## Features
* Modular Android App Architecture.
* MVVM Architecture + Repository design Pattern.
* Jetpack Libraries and Architecture Components.
* Kotlin Gradle DSL.
* Ready for Production

## Modules

Modules are collection of source files and build settings that allow you to divide a project into discrete units of functionality. In this case apart from dividing by functionality/responsibility, existing the following dependence between them. The project is divided into 4 Modules :

#### App module

The `:app` module is an [com.android.application](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/), which is needed to create the app bundle.

#### Core module

The `:core` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library) for serving network requests. Providing the data source for the many features that require it.

#### Common module

The `:common` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library) only contains code and resources which are shared between feature modules. Reusing this way resources, layouts, views, and components in the different features modules, without the need to duplicate code.

#### Feature module

The `:feature` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library) which is a module containing a specific feature, isolated from the rest in accordance with business logic.

## Getting started

There are a few ways to open this project.

### Android Studio

1. `Android Studio` -> `File` -> `New` -> `From Version control` -> `Git`
2. Enter `https://github.com/yodeput/NewsApp-Compose.git` into URL field an press `Clone` button

### Command-line + Android Studio

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/yodeput/NewsApp-Compose.git` command to clone project
2. Open `Android Studio` and select `File | Open...` from the menu. Select cloned directory and press `Open` button

### Project configuration

Add parameters in the locale.properties file as shown in the example below.

```properties
api_key="Your API Key"
```

You can get an Api Key from [NEWS API ORG](https://newsapi.org/) 

1. Open [NEWS API](https://newsapi.org/) -> `Get API Key?`
2. Paste copied key into `local.properties` with parameter (`api_key`)
